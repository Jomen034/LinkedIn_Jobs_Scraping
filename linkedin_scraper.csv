Hands-on experience using mocking frameworks to create unit tests with 100% code coverage.
Ability to work with a structured and disciplined approach - we aim for the highest quality the first time and every time, not “hacking”.

Software Engineer - Billing,Xendit,1 week ago,Be among the first 25 applicants,Entry level,Engineering,Computer Software,"Xendit provides payment infrastructure across Southeast Asia, with a focus on Indonesia and the Philippines. We process payments, power marketplaces, disburse payroll and loans, provide KYC solutions, prevent fraud, and help businesses grow exponentially. We serve our customers by providing a suite of world-class APIs, eCommerce platform integrations, and easy to use applications for individual entrepreneurs, SMEs, and enterprises alike.

Our main focus is building the most advanced payment rails for Southeast Asia, with a clear goal in mind — to make payments across in SEA simple, secure and easy for everyone. We serve thousands of businesses ranging from SMEs to multinational enterprises, and process millions of transactions monthly. We've been growing rapidly since our inception in 2015, onboarding hundreds of new customers every month, and backed by global top-10 VCs. We're proud to be featured on among the fastest growing companies by Y-Combinator.

Billing

As part of the team that designs the billing experience for the customer, you will be tasked with building processes that will impact how Xendit collects fees and charges from the merchant. In designing this system we are looking to minimise the friction involved in settling an invoice. This can be through providing different methods of settling the invoice, providing more flexible payment terms, or creating automated processes that will conveniently settle the billing amount for the merchant without any action needed. As billing performance comes down to how easy and frictionless we can make the experience for the merchant, decreasing the steps needed and procedures in the way of settling an invoice is key to providing a well-rounded billing experience for the customer.

Mission

Accurately and reliably deliver billing solutions for all customers.

Accuracy

The main pillar for our billing documents is the accuracy - as this is the first impression that the merchant can receive in order to build trust with Xendit. When billing documents are correctly calculated with all the fees & charges clearly laid out, the merchant will be able to trust that the billing amount is the right amount.

Creating accurate billing documents requires the ability to handle large volumes of data and understanding the differences between the products that make up the transaction data. In combination with this, the transaction data will need to be manipulated to include the merchant data with agreed rates and any special arrangements. Putting all of these pieces together requires a curiosity to understand how transactions are designed at the product level in order to aggregate them into a convenient and accurate document for the merchant.

Reliability

Every month Xendit Group produces more than a thousand customer invoices for all our merchants and delivers them to customers on a set schedule. Every month the merchant list grows but the set schedule needs to be maintained for internal reporting and customer agreements. To tackle this issue our Billing team builds an iterative robust system that is prepared to scale with our merchant base whilst maintaining reliability of delivery. Problem-solving and investigative traits are a huge asset of being able to evaluate the current system to prepare it for the next iteration and set it in the right standing for scalability.
